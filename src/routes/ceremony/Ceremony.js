            <h3>About the church</h3>
            <p>All Saints Church is a medieval church with parts dating from the 13th century.
              The main features of the body of the Church are the beautiful reredos, depicting
              The Last Supper, and the fine Jacobean pulpit with its intricate carvings.
              The Tower has a peal of 8 bells that are regularly rung before Services.</p>
            <p>The church was chosen because it is Dan&#8217;s family church.</p>
